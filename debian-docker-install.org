#+TITLE: How To Install Docker on Debian
#+DATE: 2021-11-03

* Installing Docker
First, update your existing list of packages:

~sudo apt update~

Next, install a few prerequisite packages which let apt use packages over HTTPS:

~sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg2 software-properties-common~

Then add the GPG key for the official Docker repository to your system:

~curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo apt-key add -~

Add the Docker repository to APT sources:

~sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian $(lsb_release -cs) stable"~

Next, update the package database with the Docker packages from the newly added repo:

~sudo apt update~

Make sure you are about to install from the Docker repo instead of the default Debian repo:

~apt-cache policy docker-ce~

Finally, install Docker:

~sudo apt install docker-ce~

Docker is now installed, the daemon started, and the process enabled to start on boot. Check that it’s running:

~sudo systemctl status docker~

* Executing the Docker Command Without Sudo (Optional)
If you want to avoid typing sudo whenever you run the docker command, add your username to the docker group:

~sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}~

To apply the new group membership, log out of the server and back in, or type the following:

~su - ${USER}~

You will be prompted to enter your user’s password to continue.

Confirm that your user is now added to the docker group by typing:

~id -nG~

If you need to add a user to the docker group that you’re not logged in as, declare that username explicitly using:

~sudo usermod -aG docker username~
